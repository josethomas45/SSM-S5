# System Software and Microprocessor

## Overview

This repository contains **my system software and microprocessor workouts**, including code and resources related to **System Software** and **Microprocessor** concepts. The content is designed to provide a thorough understanding of the architecture, design, and programming aspects of system software and microprocessor-based systems.

### Key Sections:
- **Assembly Programming**: Demonstrates low-level programming using assembly language, providing an insight into hardware-software interaction.
- **Microprocessor Architecture**: Contains information and examples related to common microprocessor architectures like x86, ARM, etc.
- **System Software Fundamentals**: Focuses on the core concepts of system software, including operating systems, loaders, linkers, and compilers.

## Getting Started

To get started with the repository:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/josethomas45/System_software_and_microprocessor.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to specific folders**: 
   Each folder contains specific resources, examples, or code implementations for that topic.

3. **Run assembly programs**:
   You can run the assembly programs using an assembler (like NASM) and an emulator (like QEMU).

## Key Topics Covered

1. **System Software**:
   - Concepts of operating systems, including scheduling, memory management, and process control.
   - Detailed explanation of compilers, linkers, loaders, and how these tools interact with the hardware.
   
2. **Microprocessor Programming**:
   - Writing assembly language programs for tasks like arithmetic operations, conditional logic, and data manipulation.
   - Understanding how to interface with memory and registers through assembly.
   
3. **Microprocessor Architectures**:
   - Study of x86 architecture and instruction set.
   - Overview of ARM architecture and how it differs from x86.

## Requirements

- **NASM**: Assembler for x86 assembly code.
- **QEMU**: Emulator for running assembly programs.
- **Python** (Optional): For some higher-level examples or scripts.
